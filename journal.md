Date: 8.31.25 - Subject: Journal Beginnings. Today I am beginning my SE Journal. On Friday we established git connections and I learned how to setup my SSH Key on GitHub.
Date: 9.5.25 - Subject: Business Architecture. Today we talked about the different roles which need to be filled in typical software businesses. Here are 2 things he said to remember:
	1. Someone who understands AND can communicate the requirements.
	2. Smart people who can build what the requirements specify.
These make up 80-90% of what the business needs. A couple notes about how to work effectively with product owners:
	- These people determine what you are going to build - you want to help them.
	- Learn how to ask good questions. Get them to tell you what they think and then read it back to them. Draw pictures of what they describe.
Million dollar advice for project managers: Try hard to make good estimations, pad your time, and get your stuff done. 
Architects: Let them see your problems.
Peer Engineers: Leave your ego at the door and look for ways to be helpful.
UX: Often don't understand the nature of software development. 
Reminder of what DevOps is: 
	Someone who is tightly involved with the development stuff and tightly 
	involved in the operation of the stuff. Worries about security, tech 
	stack, infrastructure, scalability, etc.
